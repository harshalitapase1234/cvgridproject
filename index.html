                        in the video game industry by producing a creative adventurous sandbox video game, allowing
                        players to create, craft and mine. His passion for developing and producing virtual Lego game,
                        with endless building possibilities, kept him engaged with programming to great extent.

                    <p> I always love to collect minial and modern furniture for my home and specify for my work place.
                        Due to covid situation as I need to work from home so now a days it's mandatory for me to think
                        more creatively within my work place. So, minimal colored furniture will help me a lot in this
                        case.</p>

                        Current app UI is messy. I think need to improve the app user interface. So that all information
                        can be found organized and easy to navigate. Also need to show the order process in a modern
                        way.

                        Problems will come up. Your willpower will run out. Like mana or stamina, willpower is a
                        finite resource. When your own willpower runs out, you're in trouble. Your iron will begin
                        to crack. You've without a doubt felt this before. Maybe You've noticed it's easier to avoid
                        bad habits in the morning. By the time you finish school, or work, or whatever else you have
                        going on during the day, junk food is a lot harder to resist.
